# Bank Customer Loan Prediction & Segmentation

## Project Description

This project demonstrates a comprehensive example of customer data analysis for a retail bank. It includes predictive modeling and customer segmentation to uncover actionable business insights.

The main goal is to **predict whether a customer will subscribe to a personal loan** using various machine learning models such as **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost**. Additionally, the project performs **Customer Segmentation** using **K-Means Clustering** to identify groups of customers with similar behaviors and characteristics. These insights can support business strategies such as **targeted marketing**, **risk management**, and **personalized financial services**.

This project follows a complete **end-to-end data science workflow**, including data preprocessing, EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), modeling, evaluation, and unsupervised learning.
