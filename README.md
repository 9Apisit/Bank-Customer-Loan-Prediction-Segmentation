# Bank Customer Loan Prediction & Segmentation

## Project Description

This project demonstrates a comprehensive example of customer data analysis for a retail bank. It includes predictive modeling and customer segmentation to uncover actionable business insights.

The main goal is to **predict whether a customer will subscribe to a personal loan** using various machine learning models such as **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost**. Additionally, the project performs **Customer Segmentation** using **K-Means Clustering** to identify groups of customers with similar behaviors and characteristics. These insights can support business strategies such as **targeted marketing**, **risk management**, and **personalized financial services**.

This project follows a complete **end-to-end data science workflow**, including data preprocessing, EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), modeling, evaluation, and unsupervised learning.

##  Objectives

* 🔍 Predict whether a customer will subscribe to a personal loan using:

  * Logistic Regression
  * Random Forest Classifier
  * XGBoost Classifier

* 📊 Analyze and interpret the relationships between features and customer behavior toward loan applications

* 👥 Segment customers using **K-Means Clustering** to better understand the bank’s customer base and uncover distinct behavioral groups

* 🎯 Support business decisions such as targeted marketing campaigns, credit risk evaluation, and product development

* 🛠️ Demonstrate practical data science processes, from data exploration and feature engineering to modeling and insights generation
